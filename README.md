# Intray Django

## Credit
The original idea is from https://github.com/NorfairKing/intray -- I
loved the prospect of this little tool, I just couldn't get the Haskell
source to build in an annoyingly long time, I decided to quickly hack
the core features together in Django. I've been using it happily ever since.

### What's still missing from my version:
- [ ] REST API
- [ ] command line client

### What is different:
- There is an Archive section


## What is intray?

Allow me to quote from the original version's
[website](https://intray.eu):

> Have you heard that all you need to do to get things of your mind, is to
> systematically write them down? Try it out with intray!

> Intray offers a no-nonsense web interface to write down your thoughts and
> ideas anywhere you go, and easily process them.

### Anywhere, anytime

> Has one of the following scenarios ever happened to you?
> - A friend tells you about a movie you just have to watch
> - In the middle of a party, you suddenly get a great idea
> - During dinner with your parents, you remember you really need to send someone an email.


### Extremely low friction

> Intray is specifically built to have the lowest friction of all similar tools.

You can add a new item with just 3 taps/clicks.

> - Click/tap the Intray icon on the launcher
> - Click/tap 'log in' (with a saved password)
> - Click/tap the 'add item' text area.
> - Start typing
